‚úÖ Unique Hackathon Idea (Picked for You)
üß† Civic Snap: Local Governance Made Fun
What it is:
An AI-powered civic education app where students ‚Äúsnap in‚Äù to their local county and get:

Localized governance updates (e.g., budget, projects)

Fun daily quizzes based on their age group

AI-generated scenarios like: "You're the county governor for a week‚Äîhow will you spend the budget?"

Gamified leaderboard with weekly civic challenges

Why it's unique:

It brings real-world governance into the classroom in a personalized way

Combines AI + Civics + Local News

Most civic apps are national-level or boring; this one is hyperlocal and fun

Immediate Next Steps:

Start with the MVP Phase 1 - This gives you a working demo in 2-3 days
Choose your tech stack - I'd recommend React + Node.js/Express for rapid development
Set up your development environment with these priorities:

User authentication (simple email/password)
Quiz system (most demo-friendly)
Basic budget simulation (visual and engaging)
Simple gamification (points and badges)



Strategic Development Order:

Authentication & User Profiles (Day 1 morning)
Quiz System (Day 1 afternoon - Day 2 morning)
Budget Simulation (Day 2 afternoon - Day 3 morning)
Basic Gamification (Day 3 afternoon)
Polish & Demo Prep (Final hours)

Key Differentiators for Judges:

Real government data integration
Age-appropriate personalization
Practical civic skills (not just knowledge)
Local relevance (using user location)

Would you like me to help you start building any specific component? I'd suggest beginning with either:

The project setup and basic authentication system
The quiz system (great for demonstrating the concept quickly)
The budget simulation interface (very visual and engaging)
